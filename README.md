## Membership types

1. **Regular member** - full member, attends meetings and can vote. Such members would be approved by the statutory body, so we would be sure that they are not outright enemies who want to harm us
2. **Associate member** (subscriber) - members who will have benefits but no voting rights. These are defacto "Patreon" members, or mostly consumers. These members can be fully anonymous and practically we don't need to approve them. This membership will be the main one we will present on the site for purchase
3. **Company associate member** (company subscriber) - more expensive membership for companies or other associations, they don't have voting rights, they can have 100% discount on regular/subscriber membership for 3 people from their organization
